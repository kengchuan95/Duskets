# Duskets
First player shooting game built using the Unity Engine aimed towards time to complete a level

This game was built using the Unity Engine, and contains all files except for the initially created library folder.
This was not uploaded due to file sizes, and would not receive enough space using the free tier of Git LFS.

This may cause issues when opening the game locally, but the built and deployed solution can be found in the ZIP file.
